<!--
	The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.

	The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.

Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.

When to use the Picture Element

There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:
1. Bandwidth

If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
2. Format Support

Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements. 
	-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>the picture Element</title>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>

<h2>The picture Element</h2>

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="background.png">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="comp.PNG">
  <img src="img-set.png" style="width:auto;">
</picture>_

<p>Resize the browser to see different versions of the picture loading at different viewport sizes.
The browser looks for the first source element where the media query matches the user's current viewport width,
and fetches the image specified in the srcset attribute.</p>

<p>The img element is required as the last child tag of the picture declaration block.
The img element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags matched.
</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The picture element is not supported in IE12 and earlier or Safari 9.0 and earlier.</p>
