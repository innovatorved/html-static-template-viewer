<!--
The Syntax For Class

To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:
	-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
} 

.main {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Multiple Classes</h2>
<p>Here, all three h2 elements belongs to the "city" class. In addition, London also belongs to the "main" class, which center-aligns the text.</p>

<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

</body>
</html>
<!--
Multiple Classes

HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes:
